# Dotfiles
This repository contains my personal configurations for various tools using GNU Stow to facilitate management and setup on other devices.

## What is GNU Stow?
GNU Stow is a symlink package manager that facilitates software package installation by creating symbolic links in target directories from a central directory. This allows keeping configuration files organized in a single place and simplifies the setup process on new systems.

## How to install Stow?
- **Arch distros**

   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S stow
   ```
   
- **Debian distros**

  ```bash
  sudo apt install stow
  ```
- For other installation methods, check the documentation: https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/

## Managed Tools
- [**LazyVim**](https://www.lazyvim.org/): In case of questions, check the [configurations](./nvim/.config/nvim/README.md).
- [**ZED**](https://zed.dev/): IDE.
- [**Fish**](https://fishshell.com/): click [here](./fish/.config/fish/README.MD) for more information.
- [**Kitty**](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/): Terminal.
- [**Yazi**](https://yazi-rs.github.io/): File explorer.

## Installation
To install the configurations, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your home directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Wallauerr/dotfiles.git ~/Dotfiles
   ```

2. Navigate to the `Dotfiles` directory:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Dotfiles
   ```

3. Use GNU Stow to create symbolic links for the desired configuration files:
   ```bash
   stow nvim
   stow zed
   stow fish
   stow kitty
   stow yazi
   ```

## Uninstallation
To remove the configurations, navigate to the `Dotfiles` directory and use the `stow -D` command followed by the package name:
```bash
cd ~/Dotfiles
stow -D nvim
stow -D zed
stow -D fish
stow -D kitty
stow -D yazi
```
